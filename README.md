# NVDAKeyMode #

This is an NVDA add-on to use any key/key combination as delayed NVDA key.

For example, imagine to have to press NVDA+control+f, where NVDA is insert. If you assign insert to this add-on, via input gestures dialog, you can press insert, and then, in absolute comfort, control+f. At that point, insert is (silently) released.

Supported (but not recomended) also toggle keys as caps lock and num lock.

To assign a key that usually you use as NVDA key, first uncheck it from NVDA Preferences/Keyboard.

## CAUTION! ##

When you choose the key to assign to this add-on, please ensure that you'll always and really have a regular NVDA key onto your physical keyboard.

For example, use caps lock as regular NVDA key (check it in NVDA Preferences/Keyboard), and insert as add-on key.

In this way, hopefully, you'll never encounter any situation where you cannot execute keyboard commands.

Moreover, notice that this add-on is not active in secure screens.
